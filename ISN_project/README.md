# ISN_project

## A project I needed to make to complete a part of my scientific baccalaureate, for the ISN subject.

To describe it briefly, it's a Hotline Miami-like that I made with one of my friends.
We made 2 levels, the starting one and another for the boss (who is one of my classmates).
We did it on Game Maker Studio which has GML for language, it's a derivate of C++.

You can try it by downloading the files of this repository and launching the application (ProjetISN.exe).

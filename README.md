Keep in mind that this does not represent all of my technical knowledge, I've done internships and I don't show here what I learnt working in companies.<br/>
My portfolio or my resume/CV would be more appropriate if you want to know more about me.

## Some projects I made on my own.

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [ISN_project]       | An Hotline Miami-Like I made back to high school in duo. |
| [Mini-Chat]       | A Mini-Chat project I made in PHP, HTML, CSS and SQL. |
| [C++]       | Some of my C++ personal projects I did for training purpose. |
